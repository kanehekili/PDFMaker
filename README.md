# PDFMaker
## Simple PDF converter GUI for Pictures using Image-Magick

This simple program is written in python 3 with the GTK3 Library. Drag'n drop files (png, jpg, etc) onto the list and convert these files into one PDF with a simple click

## Prerequisites
* python 3.x
* image-magick
* python-gobject 3.x

### Limitations
Can only convert files that image-magick can. So mostly image files, no text files

### Thanks
To Erich, whose idea this was
